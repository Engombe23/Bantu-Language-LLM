## üöÄ Vision

Modern machine translation (MT) models, even transformer-based ones, fail to achieve **true accuracy** for morphologically rich languages such as those in the **Bantu family** (Swahili, Zulu, Kikuyu, etc.).  
These languages carry deep meaning within prefixes, suffixes, tone, and vowel harmony ‚Äî features traditional models tokenize away.

**Morphology MT API** introduces a new paradigm:  
> A developer-ready API that layers *linguistic intelligence* over existing ML models, enabling morphologically perfect translation.

## üß† Motivation

Fine-tuning large neural models like MarianMT or NLLB improves translation statistically, not linguistically.  
For Bantu languages, this approach hits a ceiling because:

1. **Tokenization is shallow** ‚Äì morphemes are split arbitrarily.  
2. **Morphological dependencies are lost** ‚Äì subject/tense/aspect markers misalign.  
3. **Phonology is ignored** ‚Äì tone and vowel harmony are invisible to embeddings.  
4. **Fine-tuning shifts probabilities, not understanding.**

> The insight: scaling compute can‚Äôt fix linguistic blindness.  
> Real translation accuracy requires explicit morphology and grammar modeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Input Text
‚Üì
[ 1. Morphological Preprocessor ]
‚Üì
[ 2. ML Model Layer (e.g., MarianMT, mBART, NLLB) ]
‚Üì
[ 3. Morphology Postprocessor ]
‚Üì
Output Translation (Grammatically Perfect)


| Layer | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| **Preprocessor** | Normalizes input and adjusts structure for the model. |
| **Model Layer** | Loads and runs translation models (MarianMT, NLLB, etc.). |
| **Postprocessor** | Enforces morphological, grammatical, and phonological rules. |
